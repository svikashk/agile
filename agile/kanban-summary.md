## Summary of Kanban
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

- The Kanban methodology helps teams track progress by visualising  their workflows on a  kanban board.

- It works great for teams that have little time for meetings, a desire to avoid any big changes to existing processes and a repeatable process that can be captured and visualised. 

- Managers and leaders often find it easier (when compared to other methodologies like scrum) to obtain management and team buy-in to implement kanban as existing processes are not touched.
Kanban can be implemented on whiteboards with stick-it notes or with online project management tools.

- The first step to implementing Kanban is capturing the existing process in detail. Once this has been done, the next step is to construct the team’s Kanban boards with correct columns.

- Once the board has been set up, chaos is limited by enforcing WIP limits on columns. This is when development can begin.

- Team members work to maintain continuous flow of items across columns. They are constantly working to handoff items to the next column. This way the team is constantly delivering features and new work items are being added to the board. 

- Daily standups are the only meeting that Kanban teams regularly conduct. This meeting is used to quickly review progress, identify roadblocks and ensure that progress is smooth.

- The team can track a variety of metrics to understand their process and the team’s performance better.

- Kanban teams are committed to incrementally improving processes. Teams can hold review meetings once in a while to review processes, suggest and implement process changes if required.
