## What is Scrum?
{: .fs-9 }

For more than a decade, companies have adopted the Scrum approach and its principles. Since then, interest in adopting it by other companies has constantly been on the rise.

And for good reasons too!

![Scrum Interest Over Time](/agile/assets/uploads/scrum-interest-over-time.png)

[Scrum guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/) defines scrum as a framework that helps teams deliver even complex products quicker and with fine quality. Scrum is lightweight and easy to understand. It helps the team set expectations, [collaborate effectively](https://zepel.io/blog/successful-team-collaboration/?utm_source=agilelibrary&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=what-is-scrum), and ultimately drive results.

Seriously, which product manager doesnâ€™t want that? 

If you ever find people around you sit through multiple meetings, use words like [sprints]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link agile/scrum-sprint.md %}), [backlogs]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link agile/scrum-backlog.md %}), and [burndown charts]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link agile/reports-burndown.md %}), you can be sure they follow scrum principles among their team.
