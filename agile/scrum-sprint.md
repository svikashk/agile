## Product Backlog

The product backlog is a list of everything from features, enhancements, user requirements, and bug fixes needed to build a complete product. 

A product backlog is never complete and is always evolving as you and your team gather new information about your user’s needs and your product’s market.

## Sprint

A sprint is a collection of items from the backlog that is time-boxed to a month or less with the goal of shipping a useable, incremental version of the product.
