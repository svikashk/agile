## What is Scrum?
{: .fs-9 }

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

For more than a decade, companies have adopted the Scrum approach and its principles. Since then, interest in adopting it by other companies has constantly been on the rise.

And for good reasons too!

Scrum Guide defines scrum as a framework that helps teams deliver even complex products quicker and with fine quality. Scrum is lightweight and easy to understand that help teams set expectations, collaborate effectively, and ultimately drive results.

Seriously, which product manager doesnâ€™t want that? 

If you ever find people around you sit through multiple meetings, use words like sprints, backlogs, and burndown charts, you can be sure they follow scrum principles among their team.
